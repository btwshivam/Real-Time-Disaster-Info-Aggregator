# Real-Time Disaster Information Aggregation Software

## Overview
This project aims to develop a software solution for real-time aggregation and categorization of disaster-related information from various sources, including social media and news portals. The software provides a user-friendly dashboard for disaster response agencies to quickly access and act upon critical information.

## Features
- Real-time data collection from multiple sources
- Data categorization and processing using advanced algorithms
- Intuitive user dashboard with real-time updates
- Alert system for critical information

## Installation
- Your newly forked repository can be cloned locally using `git clone <YOUR FORKED REPO URL>`.
If you've added code, then test suites must be added.
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/btwshivam/Real-Time-Disaster-Info-Aggregator.git>

- 2  Make the Real-Time-Disaster-Info-Aggregator's repo your `git upstream` for your local repo.

- 3 Make the desired changes to project.

- 4 Run the app and test your changes.

- 5 After making changes you can add them to git locally using `git add <file_name>`(to add changes only in a particular file) or `git add .` (to add all changes).

- 6 After adding the changes you need to commit them using `git commit -m '<commit message>'`(look at the commit guidelines below for commit messages).

- 7 Once you have successfully commited your changes, you need to push the changes to the forked repo on github using: `git push origin <branch_name>`.(Here branch name must be name of the branch you want to push the changes to.)

- 8 Ensure the test suite passes, either locally or on CI once a PR has been created.

- 9 Review and address comments on your pull request if requested.
